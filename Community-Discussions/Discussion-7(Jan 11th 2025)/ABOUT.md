## Introduction to Qiskit Quantum Info Module
### By: Archit Chadalawada

This discussion features a dive into the `quantum-info` module of Qiskit which is used to obtain the quantum properties of the output state of a quantum circuit. It involves hands-on coding with exercizes and mathematical verification of results as well a homework problem for practice.

The topics discussed include:
* The need for qiskit `quantum-info` module.
* Finding state vectors of resultant quantum states in dirac notation and bloch sphere visualizations.
* Finding measurement probabilities for each output state.
* Sampling and visualizing measurement counts using the `quantum-info` module (rather than AerSimulator)
* Computing expectation values of a quantum state with respect to observables (represented as hermitian matrices).
* Computing the density matrices (with partial traces) of quantum states.
* Obtaining the unitary matrix that represents the unitary transformation performed by an entire `QuantumCircuit`.
* Experiments with Bell states and GHZ states.


## Steps for you to take
1. Watch the lecture video on the QuantUs YouTube channel (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZbDepT2N_E)
2. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook containing the code (shared in this directory).
3. Solve the homework problem and verify its results mathematically.
