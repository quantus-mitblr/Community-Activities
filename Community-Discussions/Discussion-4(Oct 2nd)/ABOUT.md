# Discussion #4 (October 2nd, 2024: 3:00-3:45 p.m.)
## Quantum Superdense Coding
### By: Archit Chadalawada

This discussion features an explanation (with proof) of the quantum superdense coding algorithm.
The algorithm is used to encode 2 classical bits of data into a single qubit through entanglement.

The topics discussed include:
* Brief review of qubits, quantum states, X/Z/H/CNOT gates.
* Discussion of entanglement and bell states.
* Explanation of superdense coding protocol with a circuit.
* Proof of correctness of superdense coding (for 00/01/10/11 as classical inputs).
* Qiskit simulation of superdense coding circuit with verification of correct output.

## Steps for you to take
1. Watch the lecture video on the QuantUs YouTube channel (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46VZFer0nO4)
2. Refer to the PowerPoint presentation shared in this directory.
3. Check out the jupyter notebook with the code for superdense coding.
