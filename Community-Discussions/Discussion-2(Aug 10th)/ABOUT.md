# Discussion #2 (August 10th, 2024: 4:30-5:30 p.m.)
## Overview of Gate-Based Quantum Computing
### By: Archit Chadalawada

This discussion features an overview of gate-based quantum computing:

The topics discussed include:
* What is quantum computing?
* Maths crash-course (complex numbers, linear algebra, unitary and hermitian matrices)
* Qubits (description of the qubit, dirac notation, intution behind the bloch sphere, tensor products)
* Quantum gates (single-qubit and multi-qubit gates and their rotational effects on the bloch sphere)
* Introduction to quantum circuits with qiskit

## Steps for you to take
1. Watch the lecture video on the QuantUs YouTube channel (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bDS4CwMXX8)
2. Refer to the PowerPoint presentation shared in this directory
