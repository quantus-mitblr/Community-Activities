# Discussion #5 (October 26th, 2024: 6:00-6:45 p.m.)
## Quantum Search
### By: Mohana Misra

This discussion involves a high-level overview of the principles of quantum search algorithms.
Quantum search algorithms are used to rapidly explore a solution space through quantum entanglement and superposition.

The topics discussed include:
* Introduction to search problems
* What is quantum search
* General workflow of quantum search algorithms
* High-level walkthrough of a simple example
