# Discussion #6 (November 2nd, 2024: 6:00-6:35 p.m.)
## Deutsch's Algorithm
### By: Asmita Joshi

This discussion features an explanation of Deutsch's algorithm.
Deutsch's algorithm is a basic quantum algorithm which demonstrates a quantum advantage. 
It can be used to determine whether a function f(x) is balanced or constant using only a single query (compared to 2 queries required by a classical algorithm)

The topics discussed include:
* What are balanced and constant functions.
* Classical solution to determine whether function is balanced or constant.
* Brief explanation of oracles.
* Explanation of Deutsch's algorithm with proof for a constant and balanced function.

## Steps for you to take
