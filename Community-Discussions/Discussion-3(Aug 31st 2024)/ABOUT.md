# Discussion #3 (August 31st, 2024: 7:00-8:00 p.m.)
## Deep Dive into Quantum Gates
### By: Atharva Lotlekar

This discussion features a deep dive into the various single-qubit and multi-qubit gates.

The topics discussed include:
* Dirac Notation
* Bloch Sphere
* Single-qubit quantum gates (X,Y,Z,H,S,T) with their bloch sphere rotations and matrix forms
* Global and relative phase
* Multi-qubit gates (CNOT, Toffoli)and the tensor product
* Quantum Circuits
